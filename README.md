# The Job Search

## I think I am the shit

- I am obsessed with software engineer job searching
- I have given presentations on how junior engineers should take control of the job search process
- 

## I Used To Say ->

- applying to jobs via job boards is almost a waste of time

- resumes are trash

- make connections with real people, keep in touch with them

## Why Did I used to say this?

- Applicant Tracking Systems ignore your resume
- Cover letters rarely read
- Junior Engineers Have the least number of attractive keywords!
- Most jobs are filled internally, never posted
- Posted jobs are often posted as a formality, already filled or going to a visa seeker

## Then I Met Danny Thompson & Jason Humphrey

- Danny Thompson has used LinkedIn-foo to build his network full of hiring managers in the memphis area. He has gotten dozens of jobs for new engineers.
- Jason runs a side business outside his day job as an engineer, getting jobs for bootcamp grads. He advocates a three step system that involves heavy use of LinkedIn to analyze who is viewing your profile, and tweaking your profile to maximize views.

## Noticing A Trend?

Linkedin is a big deal.
